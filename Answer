We try to use subquery as in Snowflake the subqueries can be run faster as compared to 1 complex query to increaase the running time.
Here we have 2 joining condition so we separate them for query optimization.

(SELECT
	PRODUCT.ProductID,
	PRODUCT.Name
FROM Production.Product PRODUCT
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail DETAIL
ON PRODUCT.ProductID = DETAIL.ProductID)
UNION
(SELECT
	PRODUCT.ProductID,
	PRODUCT.Name
FROM Production.Product PRODUCT
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail DETAIL
ON PRODUCT.rowguid = DETAIL.rowguid)
